GT-Student-Foundation-Investment-Challenge
==========================================

A stock portfolio challenge written in 2006.


## About ##
This is the last copy I have saved of the GT Investment Challenge that I wrote in
2006 and ran the Spring of 2006 to encourage new members to be more involved in the stock market and to be used for mentoring new analysts.

The Georgia Tech Student Foundation is the largest student run fund in the nation, started with 100,000 from an endowment by J. Erskine Love and paying out to student organizations each year. 

## TODO ##
Looking at this code a decade later, immediate things come to mind
- Use MySQL PDO
- Abstract more queries to an engine like an orm
- Salt Passwords
- Create Schema and Migration files.



You probably shouldn't use this version on a production server.
It's nice to see for reference though.
